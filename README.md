The development of Crystallize is an attempt to address the complexity issues of earlier implementations of LEIA (and its
predecessor LExAu).

Where the Java implementation of LEIA is based on mutable objects that needs synchronized updates,
Crystallize is based on immutable objects. When the model is updated, a layer of slightly modified objects is added to the
previous model, thus resulting in a new model. Processes that are still evaluation the old model can continue their work
unimpeded. In this way, many processes that produce updated versions of the model itself, as well as derived models can
operate in parallel.
